# ADTA 5410 - Streamlit Dashboard

### Customer Lifetime Value Dashboard
This Streamlit dashboard was built as part of a graduate-level analytics course to explore the behavioral drivers of Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).

### Project Objective
The goal of this project was to move beyond simple spend-based predictions and uncover deeper insights into customer behavior.

### Key Features
- Interactive filters for customer segments (region, sessions, returns, premium status, device)
- Outlier-aware visualizations using MAD filtering
- Tier-based comparisons of CLV, sessions, and email open rates
- Pairplot and heatmap to explore correlation structure

### Key Takeaways
- High spend does not always translate to predictable long-term value
- Behavioral variables like website sessions and email engagement do not strongly differentiate CLV across spending tiers
- Predictive power appears stronger in low and medium spend tiers, suggesting high spenders are more volatile
